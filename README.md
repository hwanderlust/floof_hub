# Floof Hub's README

## Welcome
Floof Hub is a pet adoption website for those looking to take in a new and friendly fluffy friend! 

You can search for pets via shelters in your area and see if they're a good fit for you and your family. You will need to register to start the adoption process! 

Floof Hub is a Rails application with a SQLite database following the MVC architecture built for fun in the early stages of learning Rails development with @AhmedRaz
